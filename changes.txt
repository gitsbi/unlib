Changes
=======

0.9.1
* no compiler error when printing quantities without units
* do not print permill as milli_scale "m"

0.9
* added ability to print known quantity types ("km")

0.8
(dead branch, no further deveulopment)

0.7.9
* bugfix: only enable unlib::min/max if the scales of their arguments differ

0.7.8
* bugfix: do not allow tolerance values with different tags than the values to be compared
* bugfix: do not allow value_casts to compile between types with incompatible tags

0.7.7
* allow changing (at compile-time) of literal operator return types configurable
* extended Readme.md

0.7.6
* major redesign of floating point comparison

0.7.5.3

0.7.5.2
 (a merge gone wrong)

0.7.5.1
* silenced some compiler warnings
* fixed a VC issue with quantity default ctor being defaulted

0.7.5
* added definitions for return types of literal operators, so users can refer to those
* by default, use quantities for tolerance in quantity comparisons now (rather than value types)
* added specializations of std::numeric_limits for quantities
* fixed tag<>::is_no_tag to also be true_type when Num==0
* fixed tag<> documentation
* added license file
* some minor refactoring, fixed and improved documentation

0.7.4
* fixed many individual issues found during an extensive code review
* added increment/decrement operators for integral types

0.7.3

* allow extracting square and cube roots of ratios (limited to a few ratios)

0.7.2
* fixed type in detail::is_same_v
* removed tag from fractions

0.7.1
* fixed pow and sqrt for quantities by adding pow_scale_t and sqrt_scale_t
* added unlib/ratio.hpp, used by other headers

0.7.0
* allowed quantity multiplication and division of units with different tags under specific circumstances
* added pow function

0.6.6
* added scalar types

0.6.5
* fixed rounding errors when scaling
* added common unit volumetric_flow_rate
* improved documentation

0.6.4
